        <p style = "font-family:georgia,garamond,serif;font-size:16px;font-style:italic; color: chocolate">The Ragdoll is a cat breed with a color point coat and blue eyes. They are large and muscular semi-longhair cat with a soft and silky coat. Developed by American breeder Ann Baker in the 1960s, they are best known for their docile and placid temperament and affectionate nature. The name "Ragdoll" is derived from the tendency of individuals from the original breeding stock to go limp and relaxed when picked up.Particularly popular in both the United Kingdom and the breed's native United States, ragdoll cats often are known as "dog-like cats" or "puppy-like cats" due to behaviors such as their tendency to follow people around, their ease at being physically handled, and their relative lack of aggression toward other pets.</p>
